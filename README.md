LintillaDancer
==============

This simple app is used to control a Lintilla via a [REST-Interface](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/lintilla-embedded/wiki/REST%20API).

It faciliats [Retrofit REST-API](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to communicate with Lintilla and offers four options to control the robot:

* UI buttons
* Swipe gestures
* Orientation sensors
* Speech recognition

There are severel possibilities to work on during the next hack-session:

* Add additional Lintilla-commands to the API
* Improve the control-paramaters for the gesture detection and orientation control
* Refactor the speech recognition to use offline-recognition and increase reactivity
* Implement additional (swipe)-gestures

Your benefits from working on this project:

* Is there anything better than control a girl by a mobile device?
* Learn about powerful retrofit-API
* Get familiar with the challanges of Android sensor information (Singularities, orientation switch, zero-crossings, interference,...)
* Learn how to use Android speech recognition
* Experiment with gestures in Android

What you need to work on the project:

* Be a little familiar with Android and Java
* Have Android Studio running (we don't want to loose to much time setting up things)
* Have an Android device at hand that can be used for debugging (Testing orientation sensors on an emulator isn't that much fun)
